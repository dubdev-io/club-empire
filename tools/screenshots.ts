/**
 * Capture every one of the ten required states, at both review viewports.
 *
 *   npm run shots                 # dev server must already be running
 *   CLUB_URL=http://host:5173 node tools/screenshots.ts
 *
 * Design review is not deferrable: the designer asked for screenshots at
 * 390x844 and 1440x900, or a preview URL. This produces the screenshots.
 *
 * Driven over the Chrome DevTools Protocol with **no new dependency** — Node 24
 * has a global `WebSocket`, and CDP is a JSON protocol over it. A screenshot
 * harness is not worth a `puppeteer` install in a repo whose whole point is a
 * small reproducible build, and the brief is explicit about not adding
 * dependencies casually.
 *
 * Every state is reached through a **real code path**, never by faking the UI:
 *
 *  - first-run      -> `localStorage` cleared
 *  - save-corrupt   -> garbage written into the save key
 *  - offline-return -> a valid save with an old `lastSeenAt`
 *  - queue-overflow -> the Door raised without buying lanes
 *  - club-complete  -> every purchase bought, through the purchase functions
 *  - reduced-motion -> CDP media emulation, as the OS would set it
 *
 * So a screenshot that looks right is evidence the path works, not evidence
 * that a component renders.
